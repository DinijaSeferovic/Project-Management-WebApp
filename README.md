# Project-Management-WebApp

This is a web application for project management, developed as a part of the bachelor thesis. It is a tool
which helps with the organization and management of projects. It improves tracking of tasks and available time in a visual and flexible way using boards and timelines.
It is based on the Kanban approach to business organization, which implies the use of a board with lists and cards representing tasks and their categories. 

The possibility of clearly defining projects and describing and categorizing tasks improves the understanding and success of project implementation.
Its main purpose is to facilitate and speed up the project manager's entire process of managing the project and assigning tasks within the project team, 
as well as to provide the project team with clarity on the creation and scope of the assigned work, which improves collaboration and organization within the teams.
